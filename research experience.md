##      Research experience and Projects

#### 1. Develop a predictive model to evaluate the significance of AChR antibody titers in predicting the prognosis of MG, particularly in predicting the achievement of minimal manifestation status (MMS) within one year.<br><br>

*Location: Department of neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University*<br><br>Role: The main designers and implementers of the research<br>Date:08/2022-06/2025<br>

- To evaluate the correlation between AChR-Ab and the severity as well as the prognosis of myasthenia gravis (MG), we searched over 50 related articles in the PubMed database to evaluate the feasibility of this study. We conducted a retrospective investigation of 100 past cases sourced from the internal system of the First Hospital of China Medical University to summarize the necessary indicators for inclusion, such as the patientâ€™s gender, age of onset, Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) classification, baseline QMG score, comorbidity and corresponding AChR-Ab levels, while establishing the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

- Clinical data such as baseline AChR antibody titers, AChR antibody titers after six months of treatment, and QMG scores were collected from 406 AChR antibody-positive MG patients who visited the outpatient or inpatient departments of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University from December 2022 to December 2024. 

- The study explored the relationship between baseline AChR  antibody titers and the severity of MG, as well as the correlation between AChR antibody titers and MG subtypes. Additionally, using AChR antibody titers as a predictor, a predictive model was constructed to assess the possibility of achieving MMS within one year in MG patients. This study took univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to screen for the potential predictive factors, carried out stepwise regression, and further conducted a bootstrap resampling validation to confirm the predictive performance of the model. The development of the predictive model ultimately verified the value of AChR antibody titers in assessing MG prognosis.

- We found  that AChR antibody titers can, to some extent, reflect the severity of MG. Overall, the baseline AChR titer has little correlation with the severity of MG. However, there are differences in AChR antibody titer levels among different MG subtypes. In addition, patients with lower baseline AChR antibody titer, greater decrease in AChR antibody titer after 6 months, and without thymoma are more likely to achieve MMS within 1 year. This study suggests that monitoring the titer of AChR antibodies is of guiding significance for assessing the condition and prognosis of MG patients.

#### 2. Established a clinical follow-up database for myasthenia gravis (MG) of the First affiliated hospital of China Medical university<br><br>

*Location: Department of neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University*<br><br>Role: One of the 4 initiators<br>Date: 08/2022-11/2023<br>

- During my graduate studies, I participated in the creation of the MG database in the Neurology Department of the First Hospital of China Medical University. Through discussions with my mentor and team members, we identified the patient information to be collected, including age, gender, baseline QMG score, MGFA classification, MG special antibodies, coexisting thymoma, immunological comorbidities, and relevant treatment plans.

- I completed the initial data collection and organization of more than 500 patient cases and was responsible for training new researchers joining our team. Currently, four newly joined members are primarily responsible for updating and maintaining this database.

- This database is planned for **long-term operation**, continuously collecting new cases, and providing information for clinical treatment of MG, even after we graduate.<br>

  

#### 3. Participating in clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of new Immunosuppressive agents, including Telitacicept, efgartigimod, and Eculizumab in MG patients.<br><br>

*Location: Department of neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University*<br><br>Role: One of the main participants <br>Date: 10/2023-10/2024<br>

- Our clinical trial received ethical committee approval.
- In this trial, the main responsibility of me involved selecting the control group of patients treated only with corticosteroids. The data collected by team members would be summarized and reviewed by me for one-to-one matching with patients in the experimental group based on age, gender, baseline QMG score, MGFA classification, and thymoma status. Through this selection process, approximately five patients could be successfully matched each month. I synchronized the control group patient information with the corresponding team members and updated it monthly.
