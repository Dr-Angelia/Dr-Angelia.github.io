###      Research experience and Projects

###### **1. Develop a regression model to assess the correlation between AChR-Ab levels and the QMG score in MG, evaluating how AChR-Ab reflects disease severity, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis.**<br><br>*Location: Department of neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University*<br>

Role: The main designers and implementers of the research<br>Date:08/2022-present<br>

- To evaluate the correlation of AChR-Ab with the QMG score for MG through a regression model, assessing its reflection on disease severity, efficacy, and prognosis, we searched over 50 related articles in the PubMed database to evaluate the feasibility of this study. We conducted a retrospective investigation of 100 past cases sourced from the internal system of the First Hospital of China Medical University to summarize the necessary indicators for inclusion, such as the patientâ€™s gender, age of onset, MGFA     classification, baseline QMG score, and corresponding AChR-Ab levels, while establishing the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

- Prospective data collection aims to gather cases from 300 patients, followed up regularly to understand their current treatment plans and assess their QMG scores. Follow-up methods include phone calls and outpatient evaluations. We recommend a follow-up period of six months, recording QMG scores and antibody titers when immunosuppressants are first used.

- This process is ongoing, and the final study results will be translated into my thesis.<br>

  

###### **2. Established a clinical follow-up database for myasthenia gravis of the First affiliated hospital of China Medical university**<br><br>*Location: Department of neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University*<br>

Role: One of the 4 initiators<br>Date: 08/2022-11/2023<br>

- During my graduate studies, I participated in the creation of the Myasthenia Gravis database in the Neurology Department of the First Hospital of China Medical University. Through discussions with my mentor and team members, we identified the patient information to be collected, including age, gender, baseline QMG score, MGFA classification, myasthenia gravis antibodies, coexisting thymoma, immunological comorbidities, and relevant treatment plans.

- I completed the initial data collection and organization of more than 500 patient cases and was responsible for training new researchers joining our team. Currently, four newly joined members are primarily responsible for updating and maintaining this database.

- This database is planned for **long-term operation**, continuously collecting new cases, and providing information for clinical treatment of myasthenia gravis, even after we graduate.<br>

  

###### **3. Participating in clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of new Immunosuppressive agents, including Telitacicept, efgartigimod, and Eculizumab.**<br><br>*Location: Department of neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University*<br>

Role: One of the main participants <br>Date: 10/2023-10/2024<br>

- Our clinical trial received ethical committee approval.
- In this trial, the main responsibility of me involved selecting the control group of patients treated only with corticosteroids. The data collected by team members would be summarized and reviewed by me for one-to-one matching with patients in the experimental group based on age, gender, baseline QMG score, MGFA classification, and thymoma status. Through this selection     process, approximately five patients could be successfully matched each month. I synchronized the control group patient information with the corresponding team members and updated it monthly.
