# About Me

<img src="https://dr-angelia.github.io/Benqiao Wang.jpg" class="floatpic">

 <br>

Here is **Benqiao Wang (Angelia,** **王本俏)**.<br>

 <br>

*Throughout my master’s degree, I played 2 roles simultaneously.*<br>

​    **Role 1: Postgraduate Student of China Medical university** <br>

I am a graduate student in the Department of Neurology at the China medical university, advised by [Prof. Ruixia Zhu](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2683-4674), with a main research focus on Neuroimmune diseases (Clinical diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis). I have achieved an outstanding academic score in class (17th out of 153 students in our major) and will get my master degree in Clinical Medicine (Neurology) in 2025. Detailed publications and research program are displayed in the corresponding sections.<br>

​    **Role 2: Neurology resident in the first affiliated hospital of China Medical University**<br>

I have also performed clinical work as a Neurology resident in [the First affiliated hospital of China Medical University](https://www.cmu1h.com/home) for 3 years and **successfully passed** the Examinations of the National Certified Physicians and obtained **the Certificate of Physician Credentials** and **Certificate of Medical Licensure** in 2023. I have gained a comprehensive understanding of neuroimmune and common diseases of different systems during my internships in various departments. I am very grateful for my deep involvement in clinical work at our hospital over the past 3 years. This experience has equipped me with: 

① The Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach to Internal Medicine Diseases.

② Strong communication skills with patients and teamwork abilities with colleagues.

③ Possessing a keen insight into translating laboratory findings into clinic, also a potential to identify the new hitting-point for experimental exploration.

Detailed responsibilities and work experience are presented in Section “Work experience”

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and sharing of experiences in clinical work. Feel free to reach out to me at wbq.898472702@gmail.com (foreign friends) and 898472702@qq.com (Chinese friends).

## Interests

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2025 Fall admission. I will apply for funding from China Scholarship Counsil (CSC) which could support my living expenses abroad. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**

##### ***Topics that interest me in future research:***

- Neuroimmune diseases represented by multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis.
- Molecular basis, signaling pathways and immune abnormalities in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases.
- Targeted drugs and precision treatment of neuroimmune diseases guided by molecular and cellular lesions
- Whether chronic neuroinflammatory diseases can be controlled for a long time based on major discoveries in molecular cytology

<br>

My current research focuses on clinical treatment and control of myasthenia gravis. **And all the fields above are closely related to my current research topic and future career planning** —— being an outstanding researcher and doctor. So far, neuroimmunological diseases remain one of the toughest challenges in the field of neurology. The triggers of these diseases are often unclear, and their onset can be quite insidious. Moreover, abnormalities in the immune system can lead to damage across multiple systems, necessitating long-term, precise, and personalized treatment approaches. Therefore, in my future work and studies, I am committed to dedicating myself to this field and striving for the betterment of human health throughout my lifetime!<br>
